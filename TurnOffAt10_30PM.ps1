This piece of program is created to remind me to
turn off the computer at 10:30 PM everyday, if i don't shut it down
before that time the computer will do itself at 11 PM.

Why? ðŸ¤”
Go to sleep lol

Step by step to make it automatic:
    1. Open the Task Scheduler in Windows
    2. Click on "Create Task"
    3. Give the task a name
    4. Under "Triggers", click "New" and set to trigger to "Daily" at 10:30pm
    5. Under "Actions", click "New" and set to action to "Start a program" at 10:30pm
    6. In the "Program/script" field, enter "powershell.exe"
    7. In the "Add arguments" field, enter the path the script
    8. Click OK
